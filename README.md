He was a prince, yet he shied away from the title, rejecting the fame and prestige of his royal lineage. Despite the legacy of bravery and valor upheld by his forefathers, he was unmoved by their illusory grandeur. Instead, he was drawn to an alternative lifestyle which suited his kind nature. To paint his canvas with every color he could find was all he cared about. His love for painting, and his desire to infuse the world with color and life, was frequently met with criticism from his family and friends. But he was resolute, undaunted by their opinions. The shallow snobbery of the rich and the greed for power never once touched his soft heart. The canvas in his room was always ready to be painted, and his artistic yearnings could only be fulfilled through his love of color and creation.

As he painted and allowed his imagination to run wild with vibrant hues, the chords of his heart were connected to a little parrot who lived in a golden cage in his room. Her melodic songs filled the prince's soul with love and a sense of belonging. The joy and peace he got from her songs was not merely due to her sweet voice, but because he could feel life in its purest form in them. Whenever the world weighed heavy on him, the bird's song uplifted his spirit and fueled the fire of inspiration in his art. The shimmering cage glimmered like a treasure in a deity's chamber, a symbol of divinity and solace it brought to the prince's heart.

The aging king, wary of potential conspiracies to upend his throne and the affairs of the state, was deeply troubled by his son's disinterest in courtly affairs. Despite repeated attempts to educate the prince in the ways of the kingdom and teach him the necessary fighting skills and knowledge, he remained aloof from all royal duties. Even when forced to attend court, he sat there like a statue carved by an uninterested artist. 
One of the prince's friends proposed a solution to the king's concerns. He suggested, "Our prince draws inspiration for his paintings from a specific source. If we eliminate that source, we can steer him away from his unroyal hobby." "What is this source?" the king asked. "It's the parrot that lives in the golden cage and sings to him. Her songs evoke strong emotions within him and spur him to bring life to his artwork. Once we get rid of her, he'll lose interest in painting." The king praised his friend's insightfulness and devised a cunning plan to rid himself of the poor bird, whom he believed was obstructing his son's future.

The King instructed his servant to mix poison into the food of the caged parrot. The unsuspecting bird, blissfully unaware of the lethal plan, thanked the servant for the meal. The bird's gratitude moved the servant's heart and he briefly considered warning the innocent creature of the danger it faced. The servant couldn't shake the image of the unsuspecting bird and its trusting nature, realizing that he was being forced to carry out a cruel and inhumane act. He struggled with the conflicting emotions tearing him apart, but the fear of the King's wrath held him back from performing this kind act. He left the room with a heavy heart and a troubled conscience.

The Prince woke up to heartbreak as he found his beloved parrot lifeless at the bottom of its shimmering cage. Grief consumed him as he cried uncontrollably and no comfort from his devoted maids could ease his pain. Worried about the Prince's distress, the maids went to the King seeking a solution to ease their dear Prince's sorrow. However, the King, hiding his pleasure, simply told them to give the Prince some time to grieve.
But as the Prince's sadness only grew deeper with each passing hour, the King's joy faded. He summoned the Prince to court and attempted to lift him from his sorrowful state, but the Prince's heartache over the loss of his dearest friend was beyond repair.
Days went by and the Prince remained in a state of grief, declining to leave his room or attend to his royal duties. The King was frustrated by the failure of his plan and the Prince's deteriorating health. Despite the care and attention from his maids, he refused to eat and grew weaker each day.
Then one day, a small sparrow appeared on the Prince's windowsill, singing an enchanting song about the beautiful flowers she saw in a distant princess's garden. The Prince was moved by the bird's sweet melody and for the first time in a long while, a glimmer of joy shone in his eyes.
Your song is so wonderful," the prince said, wiping away his tears. "I don't know why, but it brings me so much joy. My heart, which has been so saddened, now feels a glimmer of happiness thanks to you." The sparrow thanked the prince for his kind words, but could see that the sadness still lingered in his eyes. Understanding that the prince was introverted and would never ask her to stay, she took the initiative to offer to live in the cage and sing for him every day. "If my songs bring a smile to your face," she said, "I will live in that cage and sing for you all day to chase away your sadness."
But the sparrow was mistaken. The prince was taken aback by the sparrow's offer to live in the golden cage, as he perceived it as an act of greed rather than genuine concern. He was deeply hurt by the thought of being emotionally manipulated by a bird, and his sadness turned into anger. His passion for art and beauty was overshadowed by the negative emotions he felt towards the sparrow. In a fit of rage, he scolded the sparrow for being selfish and using his misery for her own benefit. The sparrow, who had only wanted to help the prince, was devastated by the prince's harsh words and flew away from the window, heartbroken. From that day on, no one heard her beautiful singing anymore, as she sang to heal broken hearts, not to hurt them.
The once colorful, jubilant, and imaginative spirit of the prince had been crushed by the anger he felt over being emotionally used by the sparrow. His love for colors dried up. He no longer saw beauty and worth in the arts and human emotions that once brought him joy. He felt like a disappointment to his father and sought to make amends by becoming the warrior that his father desired. He put aside his artistic pursuits and dedicated himself to mastering the art of combat, determined to become a formidable and merciless warrior. The painter inside him was gone and buried deep down inside.
As time passed, the prince worked tirelessly to become a fierce warrior, feared by even his strongest foes. His reputation for bravery and prowess in battle spread throughout the kingdom. One day, he was sent to the furthest forest in the kingdom to quell a rebellion. Despite the odds against him and his small band of soldiers, the prince fought valiantly against the rebels. However, as the battle raged on, it became clear that the rebels outnumbered the soldiers. Faced with this dire situation, the prince ordered one of his soldiers to return to the camp to bring back reinforcements, while he stayed behind to hold off the rebels.
In the end, the prince found himself surrounded by the surviving rebels, but he fought like a true warrior, taking down one opponent after another with unmatched bravery and skill. Despite his bravery, he was badly injured in the fight and lay on the battlefield, surrounded by the bodies of his fallen enemies.
This fearsome battle was witnessed by some birds, and they were in awe of the prince's bravery. But even after his valiant efforts, he was gravely wounded, which left many of the birds feeling a mix of admiration and sorrow. Among them was a bird who remembered the prince from a story told to her by a dear friend, a sparrow. This bird flew to the sparrow to deliver the news of the prince's condition. Although the sparrow was now old and weak, she was determined to reach the prince, despite the daunting journey ahead of her. Fueled by love and fierce devotion, she set out to be by his side, determined to do what she could to help heal the prince's wounds.
Seeing the prince in such a dire state evoked deep emotions in the bird. She started singing with an admirable spirit to heal the prince with her song. The sparrow's song was a symphony of hope and love. As the notes reached the prince's ears, he felt a rush of energy, and a glimmer of life returned to him. Despite her age and frailty, the little sparrow had flown miles to be by his side, hoping to heal the wounds of his body and soul with her song.
Her tears streamed down her face as she sang, her voice filled with the longing and passion of years past. And as the final notes echoed through the air, the sparrow fell from the branch she had perched on.
As she fell, the prince caught her delicate, fragile body in his strong arms. Her eyes were about to close forever, but there was contentment in them knowing she had fulfilled her task. He was struck by the realization that it was her singing that brought him back from the brink of death. As she slowly closed her eyes, the prince gazed into them and saw the love and selflessness she held within. It was then that he felt a deep sense of regret and remorse for how he had treated her in the past. He had been wrong to judge her motives and had taken her kindness for granted. His eyes couldn't control his tears anymore, and they fell on the soft, lifeless body of the poor departed soul.
Grief overwhelmed the prince as he held her lifeless form in his arms. He was filled with a sadness and emptiness that he had never felt before. He knew that he could never make amends for the pain he had caused her, but he could honor her memory by taking her away from his kingdom and laying her to rest in a place of peace. The prince carried her tenderly, tears streaming down his face, as he walked further away from the kingdom which turned him from a colorful person to a heartless soul.
However, the prince could not shake off the feeling of guilt and remorse for the way he had treated the little sparrow. The thought of her singing to heal broken hearts, only to be scolded and banished by him, weighed heavily on his conscience. He was filled with regret for not recognizing her true intentions and for causing her harm 
I have committed a grave, unforgivable sin,’ he thought. The prince felt that his punishment was the praise and accolades he would receive from his father and countrymen for giving them victory. This proved to be true, as everyone in the kingdom was eager to get a glimpse of the prince and praise him for his bravery. He endured all the praise bestowed upon him, as it only reminded him of his past mistakes. Every accolade would pierce his eardrums, but he was determined to hear it all. This was his punishment.
